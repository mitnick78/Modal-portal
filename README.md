# React Modal Project

## Description

This project showcases a reusable modal component in a React application built with TypeScript. The modal is implemented following best practices, including accessibility features, performance optimizations, and modern UI/UX design. React Portals are utilized to render the modal outside the standard DOM hierarchy, ensuring seamless integration with the rest of the application.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed components for improved development experience and fewer runtime errors.
- **Portals**: Modal rendering using React Portals to manage UI hierarchy effectively.
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation (Escape key) and ARIA attributes are included to enhance accessibility.
- **Responsive Design**: The modal is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Click Outside to Close**: The modal closes when clicking outside the content area.
- **Close on Escape**: The modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key.
